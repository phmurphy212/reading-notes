## Links

In this section, Duckett goes over how to create absolute and relative linking through the ```<a>``` tag. He discusses the formatting for that tag, and also talks about how you can bounce a user around the different components of a webpage by referencing the tag id.

## Layout

As with every time I have to learn something about actually designing a webpage, I reading through this reminds me how much it isn't my calling.

The reading starts with talking about positioning, which comes in 4 varieties:
* absolute
* fixed
* static
* relative

Then Duckett spent a really long time talking about floats. While that informational knowledge is probably useful, I know firsthand that floats are impossible to use, ha. But seriously, it's good to see a lot of the things that can be done with floats, but this will take some serious practice to get right.

## Functions, Methods, and Objects

And we're back to the part of coding that I'm passionate about. This is the first time where I really feel excited about what we're learning, as these are concepts I know of, but don't know much about. 

For the sake of brevity, this reading is mostly a basic overview of functions and how they work. 

My main takeaway was the formatting of a function, and how to call it.

```
function functionForPhil(actionVerb){
  console.log(`This is a function that ${actionVerb}s for Phil);
}

functionForPhil(eat);
```

I *think* that code would return a console log that said

```
This is a function that eats for Phil
```

Anyway, pretty pumped to keep learning more about these things!
