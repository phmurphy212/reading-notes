# HTML & CSS - Jon Duckett

## Images

So the images section is actually *fairly* straigtforward. It discusses storing your images and some best practices around that. It also talks about how the placement of your image tags impacts how it looks on the page. Duckett discusses setting the size of your image, and also how to make captions. I did appreciate the quick visual design tooling list that was listed in the book. I like to use several tools such as [Canva](https://canva.com) for general image manipulation, and [this tool](https://remove.bg) to take the background off of an image.

## Colors

In this section, the main takeaway for me was that there are 3 distinct ways to identify colors
* Color name
* RGB
* HEX

The are all related to each other in their own way, but you can use any of them in CSS. This section also gets into something called HSL and HSLA, which are ways that you can manipulate your images, but for this I would likely just use a GUI tool like Canva to achieve this effect prior to adding to the page.

## Text

Alright, well there are about a zillion ways that you can manipulate your text in order to get it to look and feel like you want it to. Everything from the size, the styling, the font itself can all be changed. You can use CSS to capitalize the first letter or words, and you can make all of the letters lowercase. You can change the spacing between words, letters and lines. As I read through this section, I'm just thinking that pretty much any manipulation you can make in a traditional text editor, you can make using CSS. You like shadows? Add a shadow! You want your links to change colors when you hover over them? Make it happen!

# JPEG vs PNG vs GIF â€” which image format to use and when? - Rahul Nanwani


## JPEG, PNG, GIF

This article talks about all kinds of pieces of information surrounding these three file types. Instead of just repeating what was said in the reading, I'm going to describe how I use them personally.

#### JPEG (jpg)

JPEG images are what I use as thumbnails on my Youtube videos. This is a pretty good default image type if you don't need anything fancy, and just want a solid image. They can't have a transparent background, and I think don't compress as well, but are otherwise pretty good. 

#### PNG
These bad boys are great because they allow for transparency which is really useful when, for example, taking an element from one image and combining it to make a Youtube thumbnail. The transparency basically means that only the image itself is shown, and it doesn't include a background.

#### GIF
We all know and love GIFs (is it gifs, or jifs???).
