# HTML & CSS - Jon Duckett

### Structure

In this part of the reading, the author starts out by giving a simple undestanding of DNS and how the inernet works. 
This is a topic that could be taken way more in depth, but the content discussed in the text book is a basic overview

* User enters domain name (google.com) => Internet Service Provider routes call to DNS servers => DNS server translates domain (google.com) to an IP address (8.8.8.8) => Connection is made and web content is rendered to the user

There are layers of abstraction in this description where we could get into local caching, but that's another topic for another day

Then Duckett gets into some of the basics of HTML and talks through topics such as:
* tags
* attributes
* page elements (<head>, <main>, etc)

We then get into rendering your simple code to a web browser, and how that works. 

* Write code => Save as .html file => Open saved file, viola!

### Extra Markup

In this section of the book, we go a bit more in depth with HTML. 

It starts out discussing a bit of the history and versions of HTML that have been released in the past. 
Then Duckett gets into how to specify the version of HTML you're using, by setting the ```<!DOCTYPE>``` declaration. 

After that he mentions something that changes language by language, and that is how to set lines of code as a comment. 
In HTML specifically, that is done by adding
* ```<!-- --> ```

Then he talks about a feature that I was unaware of with HTML, and that is the ability to set id and class attributes. 

This is essentially giving a name to an individual element of code, or applying a name to multiple parts of a webpage
```
<p id="watermelon"> Whatever code you want to type </p>
<p class="superfluous"> Words that have no meaning </p>
<p class="superfluous"> More words that have no meaning </p>
```

He also talks about block elements, like making a bulleted or numbered list, and inline elements, such as bolding a specific word or words. 

### HTML5 Layout

This section talks a bit about headers and footers, and how they can be used both for an entire page, as well as within an idividual subsection of the page. Then it talks about the use of the ```<nav>``` tag to create a navigation pane for your website. 

It also talks about the ```<article>``` tag and how to use it within your website, if the material is a self-contained part of the page. We also learned how the ```<aside>``` tag is used, and the differences when used inside or outside of the ```<article>``` tag.

All in all, this section goes through and discusses all of the layout functionality that is built in to HTML5 and gives some easy to read examples of how they are used. 

### Process & Design

This last section from this text book gets into the best ways to design your webpage. It covers things like site maps and wire frames, which can be used to plan the layout of your webpage. 

The big take away is that the design of your webpage should be optimized to meet the goal of the visitors of your page. If you are a sales platform, a blog, or a social media site, the way you design your site will differ, and should be created to make your customer's experience the best that it can be. 


# Javascript & Jquery - Jon Duckett

### The ABC of Programming

This text describes the steps of creating a script as 
1. Define the goal
2. Design the script
3. Code each step
(p. 17)

This essentially reiterates what was discussed in the other text book, of essentially working backwards from your customer need. 

The first thing we want to do is to really define the problem that we're trying to solve with our software. Once we've done that, we can go forward with clarity on actually implementing the solution we intend to create. 

One of the ways to do this is to use the techniques from the first text, and create a wire frame of some sort to map out what you will need to do to create a viable product. 

He then goes on to write about the components to a script, like objects and types. These are the frameworks for code, and are what actually create the website that you're building. 

Finally he gets into how Javascript gets used in an HTML document and the steps that are required to make that happen.
