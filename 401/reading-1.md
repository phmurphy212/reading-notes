## Reading 1

1. Describe (in plain English) what Array.map() does:

  * Array.map takes in an array, iterates over its elements, and performs an action on each one, specified by the developer, and returns a new array

2. Describe (in plain English) what Array.reduce() does:

 * Array.reduce takes in an array, iterates over its elements and returns a new array of all elements within the original array that meet the defined parameter in the reduce

3. Provide code snippets showing how to use superagent() to fetch data from a URL and log the result: 

 * Gonna be completely honest, I don't really know how this works well enough to write my own code ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

4. Explain promises as though you were mentoring a Code 301 level student

 * A promise is essentially a placeholder for a piece of information you don't know quite yet...I think

5. Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous? Why or Why Not?

 * I don't think so. Just because a function is called as an argument to another function, that doesn't make it asynchronous necessarily. I suppose if a function performs some asynchronous action it could be, but I don't think it is by default
